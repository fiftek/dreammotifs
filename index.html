 	<p align="center" >dreams can often be a portal to the deepest parts of your mind. <br />they are how our brains make sense of the world around us.</p>
 
 <div style="text-align: center"><img src= "final_gifs/falling2.gif"  alt="Falling"/>
 	<p> I turn around to lay on my stomach but as I do so my bed <br />disappears from under me and fall into into a black abyss</p>
 
 
 <div style="text-align: center"><img src= "final_gifs/flying2.gif"  alt="Flying"/>
 	<p>As I woke up from my nap or at least I thought I did, I push <br />myself up to find that I cant stand up. I was floating face down.</p>
 
 <div style="text-align: center"><img src= "final_gifs/chased2.gif"  alt="Chased"/>
 	<p>Feeling an ominous presence behind me I started to walk faster<br /> away from the car. I turned around when I shouldnt have. The dark<br /> mass was approaching with frightening speed.  

 <div style="text-align: center"><img src= "final_gifs/paralysis2.gif"alt="Paralysis"/>
 	<p>I tried to shake free but I couldnt shake what felt like 300 <br />pounds off my chest. It was getting harder to breath. All I could do <br />was stare up and wait for it to end.
 
 <div style="text-align: center"><img src= "final_gifs/sexual2.gif" alt="Sexual"/>
 	<p>I leaned in, my hands where sweaty from my nerves. Ive never done<br /> this before, but here I am with him.</p>
